Not only is this a really important event for club members to attend but it’s also a great laugh which ends up with a <span style="font-weight: bold">well earned curry</span> (usually around 10pm…)! Nothing builds the appetite like a generous serving of democracy so <span style="font-weight: bold">bring snacks</span> to keep you going!!! <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">Open Committee Meeting Date – Tuesday 1st March, UG</span><span style="color: #00FF00">06</span><span style="color: #FF0000"> in the Learning Centre</span></span></span><br /><br />Before the AGM we run an open committee meeting where anyone who might be interested in running for a committee position can come along and get a feel for how the meetings work and also ask any questions of the current committee concerning life, the universe and general climbing shenanigans!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #400080">So this is how things work…</span></span></span><br /><br />If you want to run for a position on committee you will need someone to nominate you and someone else to second that nomination. You will also need to prepare a short speech detailing why you want to take up the role. Finally, you will have to field a few questions from the audience, which will be answered by everyone running for the post in question. Votes will then be given via anonymous electronic clickers, if they work. Any member of UBMC can run for a committee position, so don't feel like you can't run!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #400080">Want to Run?<br /></span></span></span><br />If you want to run for any of the positions listed below then you should start to think about the following;<br /><br />1. Talk to someone on committee about what being on committee involves, preferably the person currently in the role which you want to run for.<br /><br />2. Come along to our open committee meeting!<br /><br />3. Start to think about your speech, maybe even ask this year's committee what they spoke about at the last AGM. For the non-exec roles it can just be why you want to do it. If you're applying for president, vp, treasurer or secretary you might want to say a bit more and you'll be expected to field more questions from the audience.<br /><br />4. Find someone to nominate you. This isn't a big deal, just make sure you have someone ready on the night!<br /><span style="color: #400080"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><br />Topics open to Vote</span></span></span><br /><br />1. Updating the membership price and looking at bringing in a tiered membership system where people can choose between an indoor (£15) and outdoor (£35) membership. The increase is to cover the increasing cost of the club gear and the tiered price is to try and encourage people who only come to redpoint and BC to sign up as members! Any extra funds we make will be ploughed straight back into the club to subsidise gear and events.<br /><br />2. Addition of a second indoor sec role – As the climbing team continues to expand the work load of the indoor sec is increasing. This is why we want to introduce a second indoor sec role (like with social and gear) to help share the load and also make it viable for us to expand further perhaps introducing a Lead climbing team as well as a Bouldering one.<br /><br />A presentation for both of these points will be made at the AGM. But if you are considering running for indoor sec bear in mind there could be two positions and any new ideas you want to include in your speech could be advantageous!  <br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Committee Positions</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">President (Executive Position)</span></span><br /><br />The president has overall responsibility for the club, and has to keep on top of everything which needs doing by the committee as a whole. The president chairs committee meetings, supports the rest of the committee, maintains links with the MAM and attempts to keep everyone happy. A basic understanding of how the committee works, and what everyone should be doing is very useful for this role, as is the ability to manage your time effectively. Being president is hugely rewarding and allows you to get to know everyone in the club, as well as have some direction over where the club progresses over the year. A great position to run for, but involves more work than you might think.<br /><br />Talk to: Michaf C, Henry or D.an Geh<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><br />Vice President (Executive Position)</span></span><br /><br />As 'the muscle of the chair' the VP works with the President in ensuring the club is running well. The VP is responsible for running the summer trip, arranging training (including Single Pitch Award, Ropeworks and First Aid), club merchandise (including fleeces, hoodies and vests), and for General health and safety (*salutes*). You can expand upon these commitments as much as you wish. While many of your responsibilities occur during the summer term, this role requires commitment throughout the year, and you will play an important role in ensuring club events and trips run successfully. An overall knowledge of committee responsibilities is very useful and will help you assist the President in the day-to-day running of the club. The VP is a busy and often demanding role, but one that is highly rewarding for those who are highly organised, committed to the role and looking to take on a leadership position within the club.<br /><br />Talk to: Sensei Chris or D.an Geh<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Secretary (Executive Position)</span></span><br /><br />The secretary's main job is to make minutes at all committee meetings and the Annual General Meeting. Also, their job is to manage the main UBMC email address, making sure all the emails go to the correct people. Another role of the secretary is to collect insurance details from all the members and make sure the participation list include all the necessary information - they are also the main contact with the BMC and as such makes sure that everyone in the club is insured.<br /><br />Talk to: Brain or Anushka<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Treasurer (Executive Role)</span></span><br /><br />Being treasurer means that your main role is being in charge of the club’s finances - both with the guild and the munrow. The aim is to make sure we have enough money in the pot for gear, trips and training, by keeping a keen eye on what’s going on in the different accounts. Checking over trip budgets with other committee members, and filling out various grant requests are also an important part of the role.<br /><br />As with any committee position, you’re expected to help out with as many BC/redpoint sessions, socials and trips as possible, which are all good fun anyway! Being keen to become a lead climber if you aren’t already is pretty important, as this is one of the main responsibilities on club trips. If you’re up for the challenge being on committee is a hugely rewarding experience so if you’re thinking of running, definitely give it a go!<br /><br />Talk to: Annie, Sensei Chris Step or Michaf C<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Social Secs (2 positions):</span></span><br /><br />Being a social sec is one of the busiest but also most rewarding roles on committee. Like everyone on committee, you’ll be expected to teach at Redpoint/BC, attend socials (obviously!) and go on weekends trips - all of which are always great fun anyway! As a social sec you will be responsible for organising the two biggest (and best) trips of the year - Stanage and Annual Dinner. Additionally it will be your job to plan the fortnightly socials! You have absolute control of them - the venues, activities and themes are all yours to change around as you wish. Even though this is a challenging role that requires a high level of commitment and organisation, it’s insanely fun and you’re guaranteed to get to know everyone in the club by the end of it! So if you fancy planning awesome socials, running fun trips and love a good chat then this is for you!<br /><br />Talk to: El, Maddy, Jonny or Lizzie.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Gear Sec – (2 Positions)</span></span><br /><br />Do you like polishing nuts? If so gear sec is the ideal role for you! All jokes aside, being gear secretary is an incredibly rewarding role in the club, nothing happens without you! (Well, maybe the socials would still go ahead… Maybe.) Between the two of you, you'll be responsible for maintaining, signing out and collecting all our club equipment whenever we are using it. That means Redpoint on a weekly basis, outdoor trips every other weekend and any requests from club members to borrow gear for personal use. You’ll also be responsible for ordering the new rack and ropes around Easter time. Don’t worry if you don’t know what a ‘rack’ is yet, all will be explained if you take on the role. All we ask is a willingness to learn!<br /><br />Talk to: Alex, John Luckett, John Harrison, Jonny, D.an Geh or Sensei Chris!<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><br />Indoor sec – (Potentially 2 Positions)</span></span><br /><br />The indoor sec deals with the UBSport side of the club, and is the recognised team captain of the bouldering team, although it’s your choice whether you compete with the team or not. In many ways you’ll be managing your own mini-club. Your main charge is selecting and managing the bouldering team. This will involve organising the team trials to select the team, finding and organising comps, arranging regular coaching and training sessions, and working with Kukri to order the team kit. There is a lot of freedom in what competitions you enter, where and how you train etc. it’s your choice whether you stick to tradition or try something completely new! <br /><br />Talk to: Brain, Hazel, Owen<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Mountain Sec</span></span><br /><br />Mountain sec is the obvious choice for most important role in the club, as it is the Scotland trip which allows us to maintain our position as a mountaineering club rather than a climbing club. In addition to all the general duties of a committee member, you will also have to organise and run the week-long Scotland trip to the Cairngorms. Whilst it does involve a lot of planning and organising, any individual with above average time management skills should have no trouble! NB: If you have the ability to control the elements then this is the ideal role for you as there may actually be some ice to shag!<br /><br />General duties include but are not limited to: <br />-Teaching at Redpoint<br />-Assisting on club trips<br />-Attending committee meetings<br />-Building psyche<br />-Promotion of nudity and nude based activities (read: skinny dipping)<br />-Grooming of one or more individuals to carry on your legacy<br /><br />Talk to: A.dam, Sam Hunt or Henry<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Web Sec</span></span><br /><br />The Web sec is in control of the clubs online presence be it Facebook, Flickr, the forum or the website. The web sec keeps everything up to date and makes sure everyone in the club knows what’s going on! Being computer-literature and having knowledge on ‘websites/html’ would be advantageous!<br /><br />Talk to: Maggie or Starley<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #400080"><br />Final Remarks</span></span></span><br /><br />If you are still undecided about running, just do it! Being on committee is a hugely rewarding experience. Like climbing it can sometimes be a bit of type II fun but in the end it’s always worth it! You will meet loads of others climbers, make some awesome friends and have the chance to contribute your chapter to the history of UBMC. In addition to this, you will make yourself more employable and pick up invaluable skills such as time management, problem solving and group management. <br /><br />Good luck, and if you have any questions about running for committee then feel free to ask away!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #400080"><span style="font-weight: bold">Michaf C x</span></span></span></div>
