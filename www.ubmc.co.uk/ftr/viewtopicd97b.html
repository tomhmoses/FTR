						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">This year's Annual General Meeting will take place on <span style="color: #BF4000">Wednesday 18th March</span> at <span style="color: #BF4000">6pm</span> in the <span style="color: #BF4000">Learning Centre, UG09</span>.</span><br /><br />Unsurprisingly, our AGM happens once a year, and it is your chance to elect the people who you want to run your club for the next year.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_king.gif" alt=":king:" title="king" /> Not only are you able to vote, but this is also your chance to run for a committee position in the committee of 2015/16!  We usually get a big turnout, so please <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #BF4000">come along and vote for who you want to represent your club</span></span> for 2015/16! <img src="images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif" alt=":cheers:" title="cheers" /> <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">On the night...</span></span><br /><br />If you want to run for a position on committee you will need someone to nominate you and someone else to second that nomination. You will also need to prepare a short speech detailing why you want to take up the role. Finally, you will have to field a few questions from the audience, which will be answered by everyone running for the post in question. Votes will then be given via anonymous electronic clickers, if they work. Any member of UBMC can run for a committee position, so don't feel like you can't run!<br /><br />Once all the positions have been filled we will head for a <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #BF4000">curry in Selly</span></span>. However, this won't be until late o'clock, so bring snacks and beers to keep you going!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">I want to run!!!</span></span><br /><br />If you want to run for any of the positions listed below then you should start to think about the following;<br /><br />1. <span style="font-weight: bold">Talk to someone on committee</span> about what being on committee involves, preferably the person currently in the role which you want to run for.<br /><br />2. <span style="font-weight: bold">Come along to our open committee meeting</span> on 9th March, at 6pm in the Tolkien Room! This is your chance to ask the committee what different roles involve, and to see what actually happens in a committee meeting.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_DJ.gif" alt=":dj:" title="DJ" /> <br /><br />3. <span style="font-weight: bold">Start to think about your speech</span>, maybe even ask this year's committee what they spoke about at the last AGM. For the non-exec roles it can just be why you want to do it. If you're applying for president, vp, treasurer or secretary you might want to say a bit more and you'll be expected to field more questions from the audience.<br /><br />4. <span style="font-weight: bold">Find someone to nominate you</span>. This isn't a big deal, just make sure you have someone ready on the night  <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">The Roles</span></span><br /><br />Each current committee member has written a short paragraph (except John, who wrote a small essay  <img src="images/smilies/icon_thumleft.gif" alt=":thumleft:" title="thumleft" /> ) on what their role involves and why you should run for it... Enjoy!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">President</span> (Executive Position)  <img src="images/smilies/icon_queen.gif" alt=":queen:" title="queen" /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic">The president has overall responsibility for the club, and has to keep on top of everything which needs doing by the committee as a whole. The president chairs committee meetings, supports the rest of the committee, maintains links with the MAM and attempts to keep everyone happy. A basic understanding of how the committee works, and what everyone should be doing is very useful for this role, as is the ability to manage your time effectively. Being president is hugely rewarding and allows you to get to know everyone in the club, as well as have some direction over where the club progresses over the year. A great position to run for, but involves more work than you might think.</span><br />Talk to: Henry (Henry), MILF-Hunter (D.an Geh)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Vice-President</span> (Executive Position)<br /><span style="font-style: italic">As 'the muscle of the chair' the VP works with the President in ensuring the club is running well. The VP is responsible for running the summer trip, arranging training, club merchandise (including fleeces and clothing), and for health and safety. You can expand upon these commitments as much as you wish. While many of your responsibilities occur during the summer term, this role requires commitment throughout the year. You will play an important role in ensuring club trips run successfully. The VP is a busy and often demanding role, but one that is highly rewarding for those who are highly organised, committed to the role and looking to take on a leadership position within the club.</span><br />Talk to: Top Bon, MILF-Hunter (D.an G)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Treasurer</span> (Executive Position)<br /><span style="font-style: italic">While being lord of the dollar is epic, it is not without its fair share of work! Like anyone on committee, you’ll be expected to come along to trips/socials/redpoint, but let’s face it those are all good fun anyway!  As treasurer you are responsible for the club finances with both the Guild and the Munrow. Essentially this just involves making sure the accounts stay in the positive and that we have sufficient funds to pay for trips and gear etc. Its simple enough but be prepared to give up the odd evening helping out with trip budgets or filling in numerous grant requests!</span><br />Talk to: Michaf C, Sensei Chris Step <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Secretary</span> (Executive Position)<br /><span style="font-style: italic">The role of secretary involves taking minutes at all committee meetings and the Annual General meeting. Also, to manage the main UBMC email address, making sure all the emails go to the correct people. Another role of the secretary is to collect details from all the members - they are also the main contact with the BMC and as such makes sure that everyone in the club is insured.</span><br />Talk to: Anushka, maltloaf (A.dam J)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Social Secs</span> (2 positions)<br /><span style="font-style: italic">Being a social sec is one of most rewarding roles on committee. The two of you are responsible for organising Stanage and Annual Dinner, the two biggest and best trips of the year! On top of this you have absolute control over the fortnightly socials. The venues, activities and themes are all yours to play with!<br /><br />Whilst the role is challenging and requires a high level of commitment it's ridiculously fun and you are guaranteed to know everyone in the club by the end of it! You'll also learn more helpful skills in one year than your degree will teach you in three and if you want to polish your CV with stories of organisational skills, event management and crisis management, it'll be shining by the end of it!<br /><br />So if you like the idea of planning socials whilst hung over (from last night's social) in selly sausage with your fellow social (and future bestie) this is for you!<br /><br />NB: You can still drink whilst on socials</span>  <img src="images/smilies/icon_shaking2.gif" alt=":shaking2:" title="shakng2" /> <br />Talk to: Jonny, Elena, Emma, Lizzie<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Gear Secs</span> (2 positions)<br /><span style="font-style: italic">Gear sec is not an easy role, however it is a rewarding one. Furthermore, the workload is split between two, giving you a friendly face to chat with when you are in the gear cupboard (which will be like a home away from home.) Regular tasks involve organising and signing out gear for Redpoint, club trips (including organising the gear between the leaders on the trip) and for personal use. On a less regular basis, you are responsible for the maintenance of the club’s gear - making sure it is in working condition and replacing it where necessary.<br />Knowledge of gear is not necessary to run for gear sec, but you will need to be willing to learn about it. Gear sec is an excellent role, as it offers both the training of committee as well as the promise of learning lots about gear as the year goes on. </span><br />Talk to: John, Murray, Top Bon, Jonny, MILF-Hunter (D.an)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mountain Sec</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic">The primary responsibility of Mountain Sec is the week long Scotland trip. This requires large amounts of preparation, the ability to organise people and the confidence to make  judgement calls when it comes to dealing with the hazards within the mountain setting. As the main voice of winter climbing, it requires an in-depth knowledge of wider mountaineering practices. You have the opportunity to take in the vast experience of those who you deal with and in turn pass that experience on. Mountain Sec is a great opportunity for those who want to really get involved with the club and get stuck into the world of mountaineering.</span><br />Talk to: Sam Hunt, Shanka J (Hen.ry) <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Indoor Sec</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic">If you love bouldering, Indoor sec is the way to go.  Indoor sec is the team captain in UBSport's eyes, and are responsible for the competitive side of the club as well as being expected to be able to teach every Wednesday and on weekend trips. Your responsibilities will include; selecting a competitive team, working with Kukri to provide kit for the team and organising competitions. Being a strong climber is not necessarily a requirement for the role, but you will be sometimes required to be a jack of all trades when dealing with UBSport. However, you have the backup of the entirety of your committee to help you out with anything from how to fill in some strange forms to how to handle the money aspects.</span> <br />Talk to: Brain, Hazel<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Web Sec</span> <br /><span style="font-style: italic">The Web sec is in charge of keeping UBMC's awesome website and forum up to date and informative. Being computer-literature and having knowledge on ‘websites/html’ would be advantageous.</span><br />Talk to: Carina, Starley (C.harlie S)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Final Remarks</span></span><br /><br />If you are considering running for committee then my advice would be to do it! I can honestly say that my last two years on committee have made my time at University. You will meet loads of others climbers, make some awesome friends and have the chance to contribute your chapter to the history of UBMC. In addition to this, you will make yourself more employable and pick up invaluable skills such as time management, problem solving and group management. <br /><br />Good luck, and if you have any questions about running for committee then feel free to ask away!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_safesex.gif" alt=":safe:" title="Safe" /></div>
